Hi, my name is Francesco Trotti, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Verona. I am supervised by Professor Riccardo Muradore and co-supervised by Professor Alessandro Farinelli, and my Ph.D. research is carried out in collaboration with Leonardo S.p.A.

My current research focuses on developing control techniques that integrate **nonlinear control** strategies with online **reinforcement learning model-based** algorithms. Additionally, my research is focused on designing control strategies for **multi-agent systems**, with a particular emphasis on the collaboration aspect of multi-agents.

The application of my research ranges from designing controllers for manned or unmanned fixed-wing sub/supersonic vehicles to controlling robotic manipulators or mobile robots.

My main research interests are:

- Advance nonlinear control systems
- Multi-agent and coordination system
- Online reinforcement learing model-based
