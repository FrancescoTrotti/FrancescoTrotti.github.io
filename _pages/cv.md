In parallel with the research part, I like to implement relalistic simulators to visualize and simulate complex environments in which to test and verify the proper functioning of my techniques. Please, for more information visit the [projects page](https://francescotrotti.github.io//projects/)
Outside of research I love hiking in the mountains, photographing landscapes, and visiting cities and new cultures.
