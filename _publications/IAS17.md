## Abstract
Synthesis and tasks execution is a well known problem pertaining to different fields.
With the advent of Industry 4.0, the need to schedule and execute very complex tasks that involve different machinery or robots has become a key topic.
In this article we propose a methodology that allows to define and monitor the execution of high-level tasks for a heterogeneous multi-robot system involved in assembly tasks.
With the proposed approach, a state-chart is automatically synthesized starting from the definition of high-level tasks. The state-chart is then used to monitor online the operations that the robots must execute.
The proposed methodology has been validated and tested in a research facility that reproduces a complete production line involving collaborative robotic arms, mobile robots and manufacturing machines.
